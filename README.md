# CS 122 Final Project: Visualizing Airbnb

Authors: Manasi Nekkar and Huyen Phan

## Project Description
Analyze the Airbnb listing service for vacation house rentals. Our goal is to gather comprehensive data on house rentals and pricing through Airbnb, allowing customers to effortlessly compare the costs of various types of accommodations. This data will empower customers to make informed decisions when selecting their ideal vacation lodging. Furthermore, it will enable customers to gain insights into popular vacation destinations, helping them discover where others often choose to spend their holidays


## Project Outline and Plan
### Interface Plan
Our approach involves utilizing React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, with Flask serving as the backend technology
Additionally, we are considering the use of Docker for containerization.


### Data Collection and Storage Plan

### Data Analysis and Visualization Plan: 
Currently, we are planning on focusing on the price and location for Airbnb listings across the world. We want to be able to create a map with dots for every Airbnb listing. These dots will be color coordinated according to their price ranges.
