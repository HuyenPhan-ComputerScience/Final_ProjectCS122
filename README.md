# CS 122 Final Project: Visualizing Airbnb

Authors: Manasi Nekkar and Huyen Phan

## Project Description
Analyze the Airbnb listing service for vacation house rentals. Our goal is to gather comprehensive data on house rentals and pricing through Airbnb, allowing customers to effortlessly compare the costs of various types of accommodations. This data will empower customers to make informed decisions when selecting their ideal vacation lodging. Furthermore, it will enable customers to gain insights into popular vacation destinations, helping them discover where others often choose to spend their holidays


## Project Outline and Plan
### Interface Plan:

### Data Collection and Storage Plan:
Airbnb does not have a public API, which will allow us to easily find information about listing prices in relation to location. Our current plan us to code a webscraper from the Airbnb website. We are planning on hosting our information in a csv file, which can easily be accessed for the data analysis and visualization part of our project.

### Data Analysis and Visualization Plan: 
Currently, we are planning on focusing on the price and location for Airbnb listings across the world. We want to find the average pricing for a specific city or area, denoted by a specific dot. These dots will be color coordinated according to their price ranges.
