# CS 122 Final Project: Visualizing Airbnb

Authors: Manasi Nekkar and Huyen Phan

## Project Description
Analyze the Airbnb listing service for vacation house rentals. Our goal is to gather comprehensive data on house rentals and pricing through Airbnb, allowing customers to effortlessly compare the costs of various types of accommodations. This data will empower customers to make informed decisions when selecting their ideal vacation lodging. Furthermore, it will enable customers to gain insights into popular vacation destinations, helping them discover where others often choose to spend their holidays
