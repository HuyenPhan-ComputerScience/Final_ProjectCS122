## Project Description

## Project Outline and Plan
### Interface Plan:

### Data Collection and Storage Plan:
Airbnb does not have a public API, which will allow us to easily find information about listing prices in relation to location. Our current plan us to code a webscraper from the Airbnb website. We are planning on hosting our information in a csv file, which can easily be accessed for the data analysis and visualization part of our project.

### Data Analysis and Visualization Plan: 
Currently, we are planning on focusing on the price and location for Airbnb listings across the world. We want to find the average pricing for a specific city or area, denoted by a specific dot. These dots will be color coordinated according to their price ranges.
